This is the code and data for a slideshow on the Rajya Sabha elections to be published on [wionews.com](http://www.wionews.com).

All the data comes from the [Election commission](https://eci.nic.in) and numerous news websites.

Came up with an idea for a story on this at a Huffington Post hackathon after the elections in March 2017. [Guneet Narula](https://twitter.com/guneetnarula) of Datameet and I worked on a calculator for the Rajya Sabha elections, we even put out an [alpha version](https://sputznik.io/rajyasabhacal/), might return to it soon. 

Used a modified version of the [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) library and D3.js to make this slideshow. [This slideshow](http://explunit.github.io/d3_cposc_2014.html#/) helped me figure out how to make D3 work with reveal.js

A detailed illustration of how the Rajya Sabha elections are done and how counting takes place is available in this [Election Commission handbook](http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/ElectoralLaws/HandBooks/Handbook_For_Returning_Officers(Council_Elections).pdf#page=407). Other official explanations of the elections are available [here](http://lawmin.nic.in/legislative/election/volume 2/conduct of election rules, 1961.pdf#page=133) and [here](http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/rsat_work/CHAPTERâ€”3.pdf#page=19), but the handbook is the most exhaustive.

If you want to know how I analysed the data, the [ipython/jupyter notebook](data/alliance_strength_over_time.ipynb) I used is available in the repository.
